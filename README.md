# quantum-dice-hack :game_die: ⚛️
A :game_die: made using a Quantum Computer built with Qiskit. Hackathon project.

## Instructions to run

### Setting things up
- Download the ```quantum_dice.ipynb``` notebook.
- Create an IBM ID and login to your IBM Quantum Experience Dashboard.
- Click on 'Quantum Lab' on the menu from the the left side of the screen.

### Histogram plotting 3000 throws by the dice on the Quantum Computer
Observe that the probability distribution for all possibilities is roughly uniform. The deviations are due to a small sample size.
